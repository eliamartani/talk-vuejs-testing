# Testing VueJS projects

## About

This little talk is to measure the importance of creating tests on our projects and eventually helping us to avoid from making mistakes in the future

## Tools

Jest, Vue Client, etc.

## Installing Jest through Vue CLI

Execute the following command. Sit and wait 'til everything is done ;)

```cmd
vue add @vue/unit-jest
```

It'll create some files structuring the whole project to start working with tests

## Testing

> Creating our first test file
